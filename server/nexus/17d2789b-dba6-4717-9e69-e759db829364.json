  "message": "Great question! Biomarkers in colorectal cancer are molecules that can be used to identify the presence of cancer in a patient. Translational proteomics research is a field of study that focuses on the use of biomarkers to diagnose and treat colorectal cancer. This research involves the use of proteomics, which is the study of proteins and their functions, to identify biomarkers that can be used to diagnose and treat colorectal cancer. This research is important because it can help to improve the accuracy of diagnosis and treatment of colorectal cancer. Do you have any other questions about biomarkers in colorectal cancer or translational proteomics research?",
